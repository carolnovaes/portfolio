# I decided to make my page on the github.io domain and share with everybody

For this, I used the following tools / languages:

- Sublime
- Github
- CSS
- HTML
- Bootstrap

### Template I used

I chose this template to create my page: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/
But if you don't like this template, there are other options here: https://startbootstrap.com/themes/

Once you have downloaded the tamplate, extract the files from the folder on your computer.

Now, opne the files "index.html" and the css "css/resume.min.css" in your favorite text editor and do the magic. I used Sublime.
